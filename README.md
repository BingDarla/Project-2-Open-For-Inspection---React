My work at front-end part: designed and implemented Price Prediction and Auction components <br>
Price Prediction Component: <br>
According to the property's condition: which suburb, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and  size of land. The calculator will predict a price-estimate your home value base on MLR(Multi-linear Regression) model<br>
All the perimeter of formulas were calculated based on the real recently sold properties records ('https://www.realestate.com.au/').<br>
<br>
Auction Component: Before user submit a bid, the system will compare this price with all the bids in database, only higher bid will be accept and latest bid will appear on the top.
